* all user i/os default to pull-up

CON pin:
  - during reset, FPSLIC drives low
  - released when ready for config bits
  - user drives low in order to start config
  - FPSLIC then drives low when preamble OK

Startup:
  - power on or RESET goes low
  - INIT,CON,LDC,HDC all low
  - reset completes
  - HDC goes high
  - RESET is sampled; when high,
  - INIT released, pin checked to make sure other devices ok
  - INIT drifts high due to pullup
  - mode pins sampled
  - CON released (drifts high)
  - LDC, HDC released

- leds
    - TXLED (usb)
    - RXLED (usb)

    - INIT (fpga)
    - CON (fpga)
    - LDC (fpga)
    - HDC (fpga)
    - config-to-chip tx/rx
    - INIT: pulls down if config fails (internal 20kohm pullup)
       => reusable as user I/O
    - CON: driven low during reset, released when ready for cfg
        - user drives this low

- clock
- M0, M2, CS0, UARTs, CON, RESET, PORTXXX

- ExternalXTAL1 needs a pull-down resistor
  XTAL1<->4.7kohms<->GND
    - on-chip oscillator; see p41

- USB.CLK12 -> FPGA.CCLK   ==> manual clock?
- USB.CLK12 -> FPGA.XTAL1  ==> manual clock?

* 8 bit-bang lines?


- Tie-off
    - AVRRESET
    - CS0 low
    - M0 high
    - M2 low

- Driveable pins:
    - CHECK pin?
    - OTS (tri-state all user IO)?
    - RESET
    - CON

    - HDC (high during configuration)
    - LDC (low during configuration)
    - D0 (dedicated)
    - UART pins

- Slave serial: M0=1, M2=0, external source drives CCLK
  - data applied on rising edge of clock
