- cartesian coordinates

    - always referred to as "col" and "row", not "x" and "y", since
      the latter often have other meanings.

    - whenever they appear together, __col__ comes first; not row.
      This is cartesian convention.

    - 0,0 is the "lower left" corner of the device when the
      manufacturer specifies a canonical orientation.

    - the unit of measurement is the smallest regular resource

    - resources which occupy more than one unit are always addressed
      by the lower-leftmost unit occupied.
